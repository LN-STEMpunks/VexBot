VexBot (0.0.1); urgency=low

   * First changelog
      - in roughly Debian format

   * created `hardware` folder under src/... for hardware abstraction
     - Still debating usage of PS4Controller

   * created `values` folder under src/... for storing values similar to constants
     - Not mathematical constants, but rather things like PINs, IDs, Buttons (for controller), etc.

   * created `math` and `math/complex` folders
     - Handles complex numbers, could be useful for rotations and whatnot.
